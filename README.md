# HD_attractor_model
Code to reproduce figures for "Active locomotion predictively rescues head direction attractor dynamics in head-fixed mice" from Alexandr Pak, Janna Aarse, Heng Wei Zhu , Jean-Paul Noel, Simón Carrillo Segura, André A. Fenton, Dora Angelaki (2026).

The model can be found in the 'model_simulation' directory. If you run the main_final script it will run the model and you can change the parameters as you like.

The preprocessing of the data for plotting the figures and the code for plotting the figures can all be found in 'HD_Attractor_Model_Final_Analysis' jupyter notebook located in the 'analysis' directory. 
 
The data for plotting the figures can be found in the 'data' directory.
